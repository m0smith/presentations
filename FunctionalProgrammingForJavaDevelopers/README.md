Functional Programming for the OO Developer by Matthew Smith 
============================================================

Functional Programming is experiencing a renaissance over the past
several years.  Part of the renewed interests stems from an increased
interest in JavaScript which hides a functional language (who
knew?). Another driver is the increased reliance on parallel computing
as noted in this 2007 [quote](http://ditrans.blogspot.com/2007/10/functional-programming-renaissance.html):

Fortunately, there is no reason that we can make our OO programs more
functional, enabling them to more easily take advantage of these
platform.

The presentation will discuss 3 principles of functional programming:
immutable data, pure functions and lambdas.  Each principle can be
applied to OO design and implementation to achieve the benefits of FP
without leaving the comfort of the OO world.
